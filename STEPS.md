# Fragment Detector Project Steps

## Data Preparation Phase
- [x] Create reusable dataset
    - [x] Ensure sets are representative and balanced
- [x] Expand and prepare the dataset
- [x] Preprocess the dataset
  - [x] Implement preprocessing pipeline with metrics tracking
  - [x] Add "Processed Text" column to dataset
  - [x] Generate preprocessing metrics for analysis

## Model Development Phase
- [ ] Feature Extraction & Engineering
  - [ ] Convert text to numerical features/vectors

- [ ] Dataset Splitting
  - [ ] Split into train/validation/test sets (70/15/15 ratio)
  - [ ] Consider stratified sampling if imbalanced classes

- [ ] Model Selection & Training
  - [ ] Evaluate traditional ML approaches:
    - [ ] Naive Bayes
    - [ ] SVM
    - [ ] Random Forest
  - [ ] Explore deep learning models if needed:
    - [ ] LSTM/GRU networks
    - [ ] CNN for text

- [ ] Hyperparameter Tuning
  - [ ] Implement grid search or random search
  - [ ] Use cross-validation for robust tuning
  - [ ] Track and compare model variants

## Evaluation & Deployment Phase
- [ ] Model Evaluation
  - [ ] Determine appropriate metrics for fragment detection
  - [ ] Perform error analysis

- [ ] Model Deployment [Optional]
  - [ ] Export the trained model
  - [ ] Create inference pipeline
  - [ ] Package code for reusability
  - [ ] Document model behavior and limitations
