    "\n",
    "**🔍 Purpose:**  \n",
    "To create a balanced, well-structured dataset for training models to detect sentence fragments in autocomplete systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Objectives:**  \n",
    "- Generate a labeled dataset of sentence fragments and complete sentences\n",
    "- Apply intelligent splitting rules based on linguistic patterns\n",
    "- Balance dataset using expansion or reduction strategies\n",
    "- Extract and analyze linguistic features for each fragment\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fragment Detection Dataset Creator is a dedicated class that prepares data for fragment detection by:\n",
    "- Removing noise words and standardizing text\n",
    "- Handling each dataset instance consistently\n",
    "- Providing two balancing strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Balance Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Reduction Strategy** 🔻\n",
    "- Reduces majority class instances (`is_fragment = False`)\n",
    "- Makes dataset balanced by removing excess complete sentences\n",
    "- No new data creation, only removal of existing data\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Expansion Strategy** 🔼\n",
    "- Increases minority class instances (`is_fragment = True`)\n",
    "- Creates new fragments from complete sentences\n",
    "- Uses intelligent linguistic analysis for natural splits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expansion Process\n",
    "\n",
    "For each row where `is_fragment = False`:\n",
    "1. Analyze sentence structure\n",
    "2. Find natural linguistic breakpoints\n",
    "3. Split sentence into two fragments\n",
    "4. Create new instances (rows) for each fragment"

    "##### Smart Expander is a helper class to create fragement detection dataset\n",
    "- It is a sub-strategy encapsulated because of its complexity\n",
    "- Smart expander follows a pattern for expanding the dataset, which could lead to limitation of expansion [after several iterations the expansion will be less than 1%]\n",
    "- This is becuase of how the pattern is work\n",
    "- **Suggestions**: You can improve it by providing randomness in steps which could lead to better results, but it wont fix the problem entirely\n",
    "- This class could lead to duplications in data so alway **clean** your data"
